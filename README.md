# hello-world
This is the repository for my first project "Hello World"
Now I am changing the readme file in the editor. Is it fine to type anywhere?

Oh, so what happens if I leave an empty line above?

% so is it a code that is gonna be compiled or it is simply a textfile,? if it is so why the # is there?
